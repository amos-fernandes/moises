# Versões compatíveis com pandas_ta e squeeze_pro

# pandas-ta removed from automated install because recent pandas-ta releases require newer numpy
# (>=2.2). Many project modules treat pandas_ta as optional. If you need it, install manually
# into the working venv with a compatible version or use conda: e.g.
#   .\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install pandas-ta==0.4.67

# Relaxed pins to improve wheel availability across Python versions (e.g. Python 3.11/3.12/3.13)
# This prefers compatible binary wheels when available and avoids forcing a specific build.
